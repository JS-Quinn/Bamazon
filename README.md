# Bamazon

Assignment for week 12 of UNC Coding Bootcamp

## Overview

Bamazon is a command-line program that allows users to purchase items whose information is being stored in a SQL database. After a user follows prompts to indiacate what item and the quantity they wish to purchase, Bamazon checks the current stock of the item. If enough stock is available, the purchase is transacted by calculating total cost and subtracting the purchase quantity from the available quantity in the database. The connection to the server is then ended. If there is not enough stock available, the user receives an appropriate message and then the connection is severed.
